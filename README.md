# Sparkify User Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for Sparkify, a fictional music streaming service. The company, operating in a competitive market, offers both an ad-supported free tier and an ad-free subscription tier. Understanding and predicting churn can help in taking proactive measures to retain customers.



### Enterprise-Level Data Mining Project: Predictive Churn Analysis Case Study

I am embarking on an enterprise-level data mining project, centered around a predictive churn analysis case study. This project is based on the Spark framework, utilizing PySpark for extensive data analysis and mining. Key highlights of this case study include:

- **Comprehensive Data Mining Process**: The project features a complete data mining workflow, with full data and code availability.
- **Step-by-Step Results**: Each step is accompanied by result demonstrations, facilitating easy understanding and learning.
- **Drawback**: The length of the content is extensive, making it less convenient for reading. I recommend liking and bookmarking for ease of reference!

**Importance in Competitive Markets**: For companies operating in highly competitive markets, predicting customer churn is a critical business activity. Consumers can easily cancel services or switch providers. Numerous studies have found that the cost of attracting new customers far exceeds the cost of retaining existing ones. Identifying customers at risk of churn allows businesses to target them with special offers and discounts and to understand broader product/journey improvement opportunities.



### Background
- **Company**: Sparkify, a music streaming service.
- **Business Model**: Ad-supported free service and ad-free subscription.
- **Challenge**: Predicting customer churn in a competitive market.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a predictive model that identifies customers at the highest risk of churn, defined as the complete cancellation of their subscription ("Cancellation Confirmation"). Early identification of such customers allows for timely interventions, potentially with discounts or other incentives.

## Data
- **Dataset**: A mini subset of `sparkify_event_data.json`, containing timestamped user logs.
- **Source**: Data available upon request at @DataSTUDIO.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Assess missing values.
   - Perform descriptive statistics.
   - Visualize data trends.
   - Create a churn rate indicator.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Develop user-level aggregated features.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Utilize a pipeline for feature expansion and vectorization.

4. **Modeling, Evaluation, and Optimization**
   - Implement classification models.
   - Employ F1 score as the primary evaluation metric.
   - Optimize model using techniques like Grid Search.

## Key Findings and Insights
- Insights from the EDA.
- Model performance and comparison.

## Technologies Used
- PySpark
- MLlib for machine learning
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
